# Borderland Buddy 
This is the main site for buying weapons for the multi platform game Borderlands 3. This site is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, 
making it easy to navigate and buy items. This site is for anyone like myself who simply has no time to play the game for multiple hours per day. By signing up to this site
users will get the chance to experience the game like everyone else who can play for multiple hours. At a small price the users will have the ability to buy weapons to use in game 
instead of spending hours trying to find them. This will help to develop the game further as users wont be getting bored not being able to use the weapons other users have spent 
hours to get increasing the amount of people playing the game. Users who do have time to play the game for hours on end will also beneit from this site. Just because they can play
for hours doesnt guarantee them the weapon they want, so they can also sign up to the site if they ever get sick of farming the weapon they just cant seem to get.
